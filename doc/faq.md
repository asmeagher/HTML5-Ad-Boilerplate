# Frequently asked questions

### Why don't you automatically load the latest version of jQuery?

1. jQuery is a great library for standard web development but in the ad world, it's often too high in k-weight to include.
   IAB standards suggest you keep your initial HTML5 ad load around 75-100k

### Do I need to upgrade my sites each time a new version of HTML5 Ad Boilerplate is released?

No. You don't normally replace the foundations of a house once it has been
built. There is nothing stopping you from trying to work in the latest changes
but you'll have to assess the costs/benefits of doing so. (From H5BP)
